# CSCI389_HW1
Homework 01 (Benchmarking the memory hierarchy) for Reed College Computer Systems Course
Part 1: Benchmarking (60%)
During the first part, you'll write a program (in C or C++) that measures the latency of reading a byte from memory out of a buffer of N bytes, while varying N through different sizes. Your program should iterate on different buffer sizes (say, from 2^10 to 2^26, whatever makes sense to get a meaningful range). For each size N, it should loop many times to read a byte from a pre-allocated buffer of size N, and measure the latency (end-to-end time in nanoseconds) of this copy, then print it out.

Part 2: Graphing (10%)
Produce graph showing the mean latency per memory read (in ns, on the Y-axis) vs. buffer size in KB (on the x-axis). Iterate to make your graph readable and useful. Ask each other for feedback on clarity. You may use any graphing tool you're comfortable with: gnuplot, R, Excel, Google spreadsheets, etc. Your graph should be included and visible from the README.md file.

[Include graph here by refrencing links.]

Part 3: Analysis (30%)
Try to identify the sizes of your CPU's different caches from the graph and explain your reasoning. (Your guesses don't have to be 100% correct if the graph isn't accurate, but your reasoning should be.) If the graph is not monotonous or not a step-function, speculate why that might be.



Did you get approximately the same performance as these (http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers) numbers? Explain why or why not.
For what I assume is going into L1 and what is going into L2, the numbers seem to be appropriate. Fetching from L1 takes around/less than a nanosecond or two. Fetching from L2 takes longer, reaching into the higher single digits of nanoseconds. However, I do not know if my computer has L3 or L4 (I am technically assuming that I have an L2, though with modern computers this is a reasonable assumption). []


Look up which specific CPU you have in your test computer (hint: /proc/cpuinfo on Linux) and what its cache sizes are supposed to be (with a search engine if necessary), and compare them to your guesses above in #1.
My CPU is: 2.3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 because it's a Mac. I'm sorry.
